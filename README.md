# TowerDefense
My First full game, and first TD game I have made.
This is a really old project and it was private for years, now public.

Now the world can suffer by viewing my code!



Worked pretty good until HTML or somthing on the CSS changed so instead of just text changing colors with "text-color:red", even emojis change color ( sometimes ), and sadly this makes it look ugly.

-A full TD game

-Hidden level (hell mode)

-Local storage to store high scores

-Random enemies within their difficulty level

-Enemies scale with game, not a thing I like but fastes way to make the enemies, else I would have to make a lot more enemies for each wave

-Different settings in the game, random tower mode, random enemies that does not care of what difficulty level they are in.



+++ Easy to modify the game +++

+Easy to make your own towers

+Easy to make your own monsters

+Easy to make your own maps, sadly you can't create in whatever scale you want, must use the options within the game.

/!\ Not tested a lot so might be bugs, from my testing I didn't find anything that could break the game.
